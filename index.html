				<h3>Read faster. Much faster.</h3>
				<p>Syllable is built to make it really simple to learn to read faster. The most common reason people read slowly is due to something called subvocalization â€” when reading you say the words to yourself, which limits how fast you can read to a speed similar to how fast you can talk. Syllable helps to reduce this subvocalization by pacing through the reading at a rate you define, only showing one word at a time.</p><br>

				<p>Once you get up to a faster speed, you can also choose how many words to show at once. Learning to read in chunks allows you to read even quicker.</p>

				<h3>Pocket and Instapaper</h3>
				<p>Syllable supports both <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> and <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> integration, allowing you to import all your articles you've been meaning to read and zoom through them.</p><br>

				<p>You can also import URLs (detected automatically), or bodies of text.</p>

				<h3>Customize your experience.</h3>
				<p>Change the font, font size, or even toggle to a "night mode" for when it's dark out and you'd like the screen to be kinder on your eyes.</p><br>

				<p>Syllable offers very precise changing of your reading speed, allowing you to read at a very slow pace as you're learning, to lightning fast speeds as you progress. The amount of words shown on screen is also customizable to up to five words.</p>
