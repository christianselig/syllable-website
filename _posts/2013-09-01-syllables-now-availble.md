Hurrah! I'm really excited to say that today Syllable is [available for download](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/syllable/id687795555?ls=1&mt=8) on the App Store. To celebrate the launch, it's available at an introductory price of just $0.99, though it won't stay at that price for long.

I'm really happy with how Syllable turned out, and I've had a lot of fun making it. But I'm not done yet, I have some really exciting features planned for the future, and I'm very excited for the upcoming update for iOS 7. Follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/christianselig) or [dribbble](http://dribbble.com/christianselig) if you'd like to see some sneak peaks.
